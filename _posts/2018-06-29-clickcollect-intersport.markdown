description: Overhauling the user journey, UI and technology for in store collections in an attempt to modernise the brand and raise online awareness.
year: 2018
overview: <p>Intersport are trying to modernize their business by creating an omni channel experience. Click & Collect is a feature that can help connect the website and stores.</p><p>It is heavily underused and has low customer retention.</p><p>I reviewed the user journey and the UI to see what could be improved and what technologies could be leveraged.</p>
personas: true
research: <p>After researching the current product and going through the user journey, from purchase to store pick up, these were the major points the design should focus on:</p><ul><li><p>There is no clear message informing users about the Click & Collect service</p></li><li><p>Delivery options are too late in the user flow</p></li><li><p>Store opening times are frustrating to find</p></li><li><p>Only slow and expensive email communication was pushed</p></li><li><p>There are no reasons to use the order history pages</p></li><li><p>Information is not shared between online and stores</p></li><li><p>There is no follow up after purchase</p></li><li><p>The user has no control over reminders</p></li></ul>
userflows: true
goals: <h3>Give customers a sense of control</h3> <ul> <li><p>Handle all price fluctuations (delivery, vouchers) before hitting the payment page to avoid any surprises.</p></li><li><p>Enable quick and easy editing of the order by using the checkout page as a central point of the flow. </p></li><li><p>Split major user actions apart, instead of having everything on one page and overwhelming the user.</p></li><li><p>Let the customer decide how they are communicated with.</p></li></ul> <h3>Keep the customer updated</h3> <ul> <li><p>Embrace more modern technologies to give users the choice of communication methods (push notifications, emails, agenda appointments). </p></li><li><p>Give everyone a centralised place for finding order information (order confirmation, order history, all orders available via scanning the user QR code).</p></li><li><p>Incorporate common reasons to contact the helpdesk into the UI (navigate to store, push notification if a store is having unusual hours on a day you plan to pick up the order, notifications if your order is delayed).</p></li></ul> <h3>Improve the store flow</h3> <ul> <li><p>Make the process easy for the customer. Nearly everyone has a phone, enable customers to pick up their delivery using their InterSport user QR code whilst logged into the website, instead of requiring official identification to be brought in.</p></li><li><p>Scanning QR codes is quicker and more accurate than manually entering data. It has the added benefit of giving flexibility during busy hours as a cash desk is not required, only a scanner is.</p></li><li><p>Consider omnichannel options, such as using the user QR code to pick up the package using the TAS in stores, or using GPS to notify store workers that a customer who has an order pending will soon be arriving.</p></li></ul>
userfloworiginaltext: <p>The original flow is very linear and brittle. The notable pains were around delivery selection and the lack of follow up options once the order was placed.</p>
userflowsuggestedtext: <p>The suggested flow is focused around two central pages. The checkout page is the central place for editing order details and giving the customer confirmation their order is correct before proceeding with payment.</p><p>The confirmation page doubles up as the order history page and becomes the central place for controlling the follow up, as well as keeping up to date with your orders.</p>
