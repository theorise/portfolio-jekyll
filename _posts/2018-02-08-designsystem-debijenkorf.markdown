description: Unifying the digital branding and UI for de Bijenkorf. Built using Sketch files, HTML, CSS and Javascript.
year: 2017-2018
overview: <p>The major Dutch retailer, de Bijenkorf have been rapidly expanding their online business. As new digital products are being introduced, there has been a need to bring consistency to the branding and UI.</p><p>I collaborated with the design and development teams to create a design system to improve work flows and to create a single source of truth for designs.</p>
personas: false
analysis: <p>The digital departments at de Bijenkorf were brought in house to develop their own products. During this period, new members joined, teams grew and the designs and processes became complicated. </p><ul><li><p>The design language varied across teams, creating a different look and feel to the de Bijenkorf products.</p></li><li><p>Designers had no base guidelines to follow and it was not clear what to use when and why.</p></li><li><p>The process wasn't agile as design discussions were only happening at the point they were expected to be built.</p></li><li><p>Developers were building duplicate functionality and designs, often including minor variations.</p></li><li><p>Bugs had to be fixed in multiple places.</p></li><li><p>The CSS files were rapidly expanding and including hack fixes, so they became impossible to maintain.</p></li></ul>
userflows: false
goals: <h3>Encourage discussion and feedback</h3><ul><li><p>Create a central source for designers across all teams to discuss and improve on.</p></li><li><p>Agree on design processes that involve cross team collaboration.</p></li></ul><h3>Speed things up</h3><ul><li><p>Give designers and developers reusable assets they can use when making new designs.</p></li><li><p>Have a central place for UI documentation to enable people to find their own answers.</p></li><li><p>Give external partners a place to access assets and documentation.</p></li></ul><h3>Enable scalability</h3><ul><li><p>The design system must start as a solid foundation that can be built upon.</p></li><li><p>Designs should be built with potential change in mind.</p></li><li><p>Don't lock into particular (uncommon) technologies.</p></li><li><p>Make components centralised to changes and bug fixes are only made in a one place.</p></li></ul>
userfloworiginaltext: <p>The original flow is very linear and brittle. The notable pains were around delivery selection and the lack of follow up options once the order was placed.</p>
userflowsuggestedtext: <p>The suggested flow is focused around two central pages. The checkout page is the central place for editing order details and giving the customer confirmation their order is correct before proceeding with payment.</p><p>The confirmation page doubles up as the order history page and becomes the central place for controlling the follow up, as well as keeping up to date with your orders.</p>
