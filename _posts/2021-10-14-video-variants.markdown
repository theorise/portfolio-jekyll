description: Creating a new user journey to support a different user input methods and the video medium for the Open DC application.
year: 2021
overview: <p>WPP are expanding their reach into online video advertising and our application is now shifting it's focus onto the video medium as it displays the greatest growth potential for the business.</p><p>This was a large project that challenged the fundamentals of our existing application.</p>
personas: true
research: <p>This was a large project that was initially kicked off by interviewing users from different agencies within WPP (Greenhouse, Xaxis and Wunderman Thompson) to see how they currently work with both video templates as well as how they create variants for their projects.</p><p>We found that our current system of generating variants by combining sets of specific contextual rules was not how they worked, they manually create the variants in a spreadsheet.</p><p>Once in the prototyping phase, we carried out several iterations of online user testing so that we could create improvements for the new flow.</p>
userflows: false
goals: <ul><li><p>Add support for users creating variants in spreadsheets</p></li><li><p>Add support for users creating templates in After Effects</p></li><li><p>Keep the flow understandable to users that are already accustomed to our product</p></li></ul>
userfloworiginaltext: <p>The original flow is very linear and brittle. The notable pains were around delivery selection and the lack of follow up options once the order was placed.</p>
userflowsuggestedtext: <p>The suggested flow is focused around two central pages. The checkout page is the central place for editing order details and giving the customer confirmation their order is correct before proceeding with payment.</p><p>The confirmation page doubles up as the order history page and becomes the central place for controlling the follow up, as well as keeping up to date with your orders.</p>
