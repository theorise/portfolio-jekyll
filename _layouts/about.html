    I’m a designer with a background in interaction design and web development. My passion lies in creating awesome digital experiences that are simple and accessible to everyone. I love to get to the root of the problem, challenge assumptions and design elegant solutions based upon research. I’ve worked for international companies across multiple agile teams and I have a lot of experience working on user flows, UI and interactions in large design systems for digital platforms.
